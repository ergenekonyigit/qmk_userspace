// Tap-hold tuning for reliable Mod-Tap behavior (e.g., CTL_T(KC_ESC))
// Increase tapping term a bit to help distinguish quick taps from holds.
// Adjust to taste (150â€“220ms is common for home-row mods).

// Prefer hold when another key is pressed while holding a Mod-Tap.
// This makes chords like Ctrl+S followed by Ctrl+W reliable when using CTL_T(KC_ESC).
#define HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS

// Ensure that once a Mod-Tap acts as a hold during a chord, releasing it first
// won't send the tap keycode (prevents accidental Esc when rolling off).
